# EM18 RFID Reader
```RFID(Radio Frequency Identification)``` is a form of wireless communication that incorporates the use of electromagnetic coupling in the radio frequency portion.<br>
RFID reader is a device used to gather information from an RFID tag which can further used for various apllications which include e-payment, e-toll road pricing, e-ticketing for events/public transport, access control, authentication.<br>
Okay! Now letâ€™s see how to read RFID tag using EM18 RFID reader and USB to TTL(CP2102)!

## Documentation
It is highly recommended to go through the Documentation first.<br>
Here is direct link for same.<br>

## Prerequisites
* [Realterm](https://realterm.sourceforge.io/index.html#downloads_Download) or any other serial terminal
* USB to TTL (CP2102)
* EM18 RFID Reader Module
* Jumpers
* Basic knowledge of UART and serial communication

(Application Circuit referred from EM18 RFID reader [Datasheet](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiAnsWJnbb3AhWLIbcAHYoWCMMQFnoECAUQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomponents101.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fcomponent_datasheet%2FEM18%2520RFID%2520Reader%2520Datasheet.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1-NdYUcDfC8h57j6CnI9kd))
* Tx(EM18 RFID Reader) ---> Rx(USB to TTL)
* Power Supply (5V and GND)
* SEL pin ---> 5V
## Getting Started
Follow the steps for getting started:
* Connect the USB to TTL(CP2102) to USB port of PC and open device manager to check the port connected to serial bridge (USB to TTL).<br>
![Alt text](Images/deviceManager.png?raw=true "Title")
* Open Realterm or any other serial terminal you want to use.
* Open the port to which your serial device is connected make sure to check serial configuration as follows:<br>
    Baudrate : 9600<br>
    Data Bits : 8<br>
    Parity : None<br>
    Stopbits : 1<br>

* That's it!!! Now you can send AT commands using realterm directly to Wi-Fi Module and also receive its response.
* Firstly check whether you receive ```OK``` in response to ```AT\r\n```, to make sure that your connections and configurations are fine.
* Now you can further proceed to other AT commands according to your application.
